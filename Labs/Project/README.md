# Arithmetic logic unit project for Digital Electronics 1
## The Task
My task was creating a arithmetic logic unit that offers a method for the user to change the value of both numbers and change with operation should be displayed while using a coolboard unit.
## The Execution
The code for this project was writen in ISE on a vritual windows 7 running in virtulal box on a windows 10 notebook. This was done because I ran into problems while instaling ISE on windows 10 as on C: it couldnt install itself and on D: it would crash if I tried to open any project. Clock_enable.vhd, driver_7seg.vhd and hex_to_7seg.vhd where taken from our previous projects that we wrote in class. Testbench.vhd, top.vhd and ALU.vhd where writen by myself. 
### top.vhd
### ALU.vhd
